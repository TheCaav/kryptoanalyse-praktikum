                        BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #1

IT'S BACKUP DAY TODAY SO I'M PISSED OFF.  BEING THE BOFH, HOWEVER, DOES HAVE
IT'S ADVANTAGES.  I ASSIGN THE TAPE DEVICE TO NULL - IT'S SO MUCH MORE
ECONOMICAL ON MY TIME AS I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GETTING UP TO CHANGE TAPES EVERY
5 MINUTES.  AND IT SPEEDS UP BACKUPS TOO, SO IT CAN'T BE ALL BAD.

A USER RINGS

"DO YOU KNOW WHY THE SYSTEM IS SLOW?" THEY ASK

"IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH..."  I LOOK UP TODAY'S EXCUSE ".. CLOCK
SPEED"

"OH"  (NOT KNOWING WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE SATISFIED)  "DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT WILL BE FIXED?"

"FIXED?  THERE'S 275 USERS ON YOUR MACHINE, AND ONE OF THEM IS YOU.  DON'T BE
SO SELFISH - LOGOUT NOW AND GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A CHANCE!"

"BUT MY RESEARCH RESULTS ARE DUE IN TOMMORROW AND ALL I NEED IS ONE PAGE OF
LASER PRINT.."

"SURE YOU DO.  WELL; YOU JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT BUDDY!"  I HANG UP.

SHEESH, YOU'D REALLY THINK PEOPLE WOULD LEARN NOT TO CALL!

THE PHONE RINGS.  IT'LL BE HIM AGAIN, I KNOW.  THAT ANNOYS ME.  I PUT ON A
GRUFF VOICE

"HELLO, SALARIES!"

"OH, I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT THE WRONG NUMBER"

"YEAH?  WELL WHAT'S YOUR NAME BUDDY?  DO YOU KNOW WASTED PHONE CALLS COST 
MONEY?  DO YOU?  I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND TO SUBTRACT YOUR WASTED TIME, MY WASTED
TIME, AND THE COST OF THIS CALL FROM YOUR WEEKLY WAGES!  IN FACT I WILL!   BY
THE TIME I'VE FINISHED WITH YOU, YOU'LL OWE US MONEY!  WHAT'S YOUR NAME - AND
DON'T LIE, WE'VE GOT CALLER ID!"

I HEAR THE PHONE DROP AND THE SOUND OF RUNNING FEET - HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO
TRY AND GET AN ALIBI BY BEING AT THE DEAN'S OFFICE.  I LOOK UP HIS USERNAME
AND FIND HIS DEPARTMENT.  I RING THE DEAN'S SECRETARY.

"HELLO?" SHE ANSWERS

"HI, SIMON, B.O.F.H HERE, LISTEN, WHEN THAT GUY COMES RUNNING INTO YOUR OFFICE
IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS, CAN YOU GIVE HIM A MESSAGE?"

"I THINK SO..." SHE SAYS

"TELL HIM `HE CAN RUN, BUT HE CAN'T HIDE'"

"UM. OK"

"AND DON'T FORGET NOW, I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THAT FILE
IN YOUR ACCOUNT WITH YOUR ANSWERS TO THE PUURITY TEST IN IT..."

I HEAR HER SCRABBLING AT THE TERMINAL...

"DON'T BOTHER - I HAVE A COPY.  BE A GOOD GIRL AND PASS THE MESSAGE ON"

SHE SOBS HER ASSENT AND I HANG UP.  AND THE WORST THING IS, I WAS JUST GUESSING
ABOUT THE PURITY TEST THING.   I GRAB A QUICK COPY ANYWAY,  IT  MIGHT MAKE FOR
SOME GOOD LATE-NIGHT READING.  

MEANTIME BACKUPS HAVE FINISHED IN RECORD TIME, 2.03 SECONDS.  MODERN TECHNOLOGY
IS WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?

ANOTHER USER RINGS.

"I NEED MORE SPACE" HE SAYS

"WELL, WHY DON'T YOU MOVE TO TEXAS?" I ASK

"NO, ON MY ACCOUNT, STUPID."

STUPID?!?....  UH-OH..

"I'M TERRIBLY SORRY" I SAY, IN A POLITE MANNER EQUAL TO THAT OF JIMMY STEWART
IN A FAMILY MATINEE "I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT.  WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU SAID?"

I SMELL THE FEAR COMING DOWN THE LINE AT ME, BUT IT'S TOO LATE, HE'S A GONER
AND HE KNOWS IT.

"UM, I SAID WHAT I WANTED WAS MORE SPACE ON MY ACCOUNT, *PLEASE*"

"SURE, HANG ON"

I HEAR HIM GASP HIS RELIEF EVEN THOUGH HE COVERED THE MOUTHPEICE.

"THERE, YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF SPACE NOW"

"HOW MUCH HAVE I GOT" 

NOW THIS REALLY *PISSES* *ME* *OFF*!  NOT ONLY DO THEY WANT ME TO GIVE THEM
EXTRA DISK, THEY WANT TO CHECK IT, TO CORRECT ME IF I DON'T GIVE THEM ENOUGH.
THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH WHAT I GIVE THEM *AND THAT'S IT*!!!

BACK INTO JIMMY STEWART MODE.

"WELL, LET'S SEE, YOU HAVE 4 MEG AVAILABLE"

"WOW!  EIGHT MEG IN TOTAL, THANKS!" HE SAYS PLEASED WITH HIS BARGAINING POWER

"NO" I INTERRUPT, SAVOURING THIS LIKE A FINE RED, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE "4 MEG IN
TOTAL..."

"HUH?...  I'D USED 4 MEG ALREADY, HOW COULD I HAVE 4 MEG AVAILABLE?"

I SAY NOTHING.  IT'LL COME TO HIM.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!"

I KILL ME; I REALLY DO!

                      BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #2

I'M SITTING AT THE DESK, PLAYING X-TANK, WHEN SOME THOUGHTLESS BASTARD RINGS
ME ON THE PHONE.  I PICK IT UP.

"HELLO?" I SAY.
"WHO IS THIS?" THEY SAY
"IT'S ME I THINK" I SAY, HAVING BEEN THROUGH A TELEPHONE SKILLS COURSE
"ME WHO?"
"IS THIS LIKE A KNOCK KNOCK JOKE?" I SAY, TRYING ANYTHING TO SAVE MYSELF
HAVING TO END THIS GAME.

TOO LATE!  I GET KILLED.

NOW I'M PISSED!

"WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?" I ASK PLEASANTLY - (ONE OF THE KEY WARNING SIGNS)

"UM, I WANT TO KNOW IF WE HAVE A PARTICULAR SOFTWARE PACKAGE.."

"WHICH PACKAGE IS THAT?"

"UH, B-A-S-I-C IT'S CALLED."

>CLICKETY CLICKETY D-E-L B-A-S-I-C.E-X-E<

"UM NO, WE DON'T HAVE THAT.  WE USED TO THOUGH.."

"OH.  OH WELL, THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO KNOW WAS, COULD THE CONTENTS OF
MY ACCOUNT BE COPIED TO TAPE TO I HAVE A PERMANENT COPY OF THEM TO SAVE AT
HOME IN CASE THE WORST HAPPENS.."

"THE WORST?"

"WELL, LIKE THEY GET DELETED OR SOMETHING..."

"DELETED!  OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, WE HAVE BACKUPS"  (I'M SUCH A *SHIT*)
"WHAT WAS YOUR USERNAME?"

HE GIVES ME HIS LUSERNAME.  (WHAT AN IDIOT)

>CLICKETY CLIKC<

"BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY FILES IN YOUR ACCOUNT!" I SAY, MOCK SURPRISE LEAPING
FROM MY VOCAL CHORDS.

"YES I HAVE, YOU MUST BE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE!"

SO FIRST HE SPOILS MY X-TANK GAME, AND NOW HE'S CALLING ME A LIAR...

>CLICKETY CLICK<

"OH NO, I MADE A MISTAKE" I SAY

DID HE MUTTER "TYPICAL" UNDER HIS BREATH?  OH DEAR, OH DEAR..

"I MEANT TO SAY:  THAT USERNAME DOESN'T EXIST"

"HUH?  >WIMPER< IT MUST DO, I WAS ONLY USING IT THIS MORNING!"

"AH WELL, THAT'LL BE THE PROBLEM, THERE WAS A VIRUS IN OUR SYSTEM THIS
MORNING, THE... UH... DE VINCI VIRUS, WIPES OUT USERS WHO ARE LOGGED IN
WHEN IT GOES OFF."

"THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT, MY GIRLFRIEND WAS LOGGED IN, AND I'M IN HER ACCOUNT NOW!"

"WHICH ONE WAS THAT?"

HE TELLS ME THE USERNAME.  SOME PEOPLE NEVER LEARN..

"OH, YEAH, HER ACCOUNT WAS JUST AFTER WE DISCOVERED THE VIRUS."
>CLICKETY CLIKC<  "..SHE ONLY LOST ALL HER FILES"

"BUT..."

"BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'VE GOT THEM ALL ON TAPE"

"OH, THANK GOODNESS!!!"

"PAPER TAPE.  HAVE YOU GOT A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND A PENCIL.  SEE YOU IN THE
MACHINE ROOM!!!!   NYAHAHAHAHAHA!"

I'M SUCH A PRICK!

                        BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #3

SO I'M WORKING SO HARD I BARELY HAVE TIME TO DRIVE INTO TOWN AND WATCH A MOVIE
BEFORE I TOLD PEOPLE THEIR PRINTING WILL BE READY.  THE QUEUE'S WAAAAY TOO
LONG TO HAVE EVERYTHING PRINTED (AND SORTED) BY THE TIME I TOLD THEM, SO I
KILL ALL THE SMALL JOBS SO THERE'S ONLY 2 LEFT AND I CAN SORT THEM IN NO TIME.

THEN, AFTER THE MOVIE, (WHICH WAS ONE OF THOSE SLACK BERTOLUCCI ONES THAT TAKES
ABOUT 3 HOURS TILL THE MAIN CHARACTER IS KILLED OFF IN A VISIONARY EXPERIENCE)
I GET BACK AND CLEAR THE PRINTOUTS.

THERE'S ABOUT 50 PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE AND I'VE GOT TWO PRINTOUTS.  THAT'S
ABOUT AVERAGE FOR ME.  I THOUGHT I'D KILLED MORE THO.  ANYWAY, I PUT OUT
THE PRINTOUTS AND WALK SLOOOWLY INSIDE, FINGERING THE CLIPBOARD WITH "ACCOUNTS
TO REMOVE" IN BIG LETTERS ON THE BACK.  NO-ONE SAYS ANYTHING.  AS USUAL.

. . .

   I'M SITTING BACK IN THE OPERATIONS ARMCHAIR, WATCHING THE COMPUTER ROOM
CLOSED CIRCUIT TV, WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE FRAME-GRABBER'S
VIDEO PLAYER (SENT OFF FOR REPAIR, DUE BACK SOMETIME IN '94) WHEN THE PHONE
RINGS.  THAT MUST BE THE 2ND TIME TODAY, AND IT'S REALLY STARTING TO GET TO
ME!

"YES?" I SAY, PAUSING THE PICTURE.

"I'VE ACCIDENTALLY DELETED MY C.V!" THE VOICE AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE
SAYS.

"YOU HAVE?  WHAT WAS YOUR USERNAME?"

HE TELLS ME.  WHAT THE HELL, I AM BORED.

"AH NO, YOU DIDN'T DELETE IT - I DID."

"WHAT?"

"I DELETED IT.  IT WAS FULL OF SHIT!  YOU DIDN'T EVER GET MORE THAN A B- IN
ANY OF YOUR SUBJECTS!"

"HUH?"

"AND THAT CRAP ABOUT BEING A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT, THAT WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AND WE BOTH KNOW IT."

"HUH?!!"

"YOUR ACADEMIC RECORDS.  I CHECKED THEM, YOU WERE LYING.."

"HOW DID Y.."  HE CLICKS.  "IT'S YOU ISN'T IT?  THE BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL!"

"IN THE FLESH, ON THE PHONE AND IN YOUR ACCOUNT....  YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED
YOU KNOW.  YOU ESPECIALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN ME YOUR USERNAME.."  >CLICKETY<
>CLICK<   "NEITHER SHOULD YOU HAVE SENT THAT MAIL TO THE SYSTEM MANAGER TELLING
HIM WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM IN GRAPHIC TERMS..."

"I DIDN'T SEND ANY.."  

>CLICKETY< >CLICK<......

"NO, YOU DIDN'T DID YOU?  BUT WHO CAN TELL THESE DAYS.  NOT TO WORRY THOUGH,
IT'LL ALL BE OVER VERY SOON.."  >CLICKEDY CLIKC<  "..CHANGE MY USERNAME BACK,
AND..."

"B-B-B.." HE BLUBS, LIKE A STOOD-UP DATE

"GOODBYE NOW" I SAY PLEASANTLY,  "YOU'VE GOT BAGS TO PACK AND A LIFE TO START
OVER..."

I HANG UP.

TWO SECONDS LATER THE RED PHONE GOES.  I PICK IT UP, IT'S THE BOSS.
HE MUMBLES THE USERNAME OF THE PERSON I WAS JUST TALKING TO, MENTIONS SOMETHING
ABOUT A NASTY MAIL MESSAGE, AND UTTERS THE WORDS "YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO...", WITH
THE DOTS AND EVERYTHING.

LATER, INSIDE THE MUNICIPAL ENERGY AUTHORITY COMPUTER, AS I'M MODIFYING THE
POOR PLEB'S  ENERGY BILL BY SEVERAL ZEROS, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT
LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT - WHAT ACT OF HEINOUS STUPIDITY CAUSES THEM TO CALL.
THEN, EVEN LATER, WHEN I'M ADDING THE POOR PLEB'S PHOTO IMAGE OVER THE TOP
OF THE FBI'S ONLINE "MOST WANTED ARMED AND DANGEROUS, SHOOT ON SIGHT" OFFENDERS
LIST, I REALISE, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW; BUT LIFE GOES ON.

   A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER, AS I SEE THE SWAT VEHICLE ROLL UP OUTSIDE THE POOR
PLEB'S APARTMENT I REALISE THAT FOR SOME, IT JUST DOESN'T.

BUT TOMMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY.

                        BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #4

IT'S A THURSDAY, AND I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.  IT'S PAYDAY.  I THINK I'LL TAKE
SOME CALLS.  I PUT THE PHONE BACK ON THE HOOK.  IT RINGS.

"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU FOR HOURS!" THE VOICE AT THE OTHER END SCREAMS

"NOT, IT CAN'T BE HOURS" I SAY, PUTTING BLADE RUNNER BACK INTO IT'S COVER
AND LOOKING AT THE BACK, "IT WAS MORE LIKE 114 MINUTES.  I WAS ON A LONG PHONE
CALL WITH THE BIG BOSS, TRYING TO GET YOU USERS SOME BETTER FACILITIES"

HOOK; LINE;  AND SINKER...
"OH.  I'M SORRY."

"THAT'S OK, I'M A TOLERANT PERSON"  I MAKE A MENTAL NOTE TO CHANGE HIS PASSWORD
TO SOMETHING NASTY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

"UM, I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO RENAME A FILE" HE SAYS.

OH DEAR...  HANG ON, IT'S PAYDAY ISN'T IT?!  I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.

"SURE.  YOU JUST GO 'RM' AND THE FILENAME"

"THANKS"

"NO WORRIES"  (NOW I'M IN A REALLY GOOD MOOD.  I THINK I JUST MIGHT WRITE THAT
SCRIPT TO MAKE SAVING IMPOSSIBLE ON ROGUE AT RANDOM TIMES LIKE I'VE BEEN THINK-
ING ABOUT)

THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

"HELLO?"

"HI THERE" I SAY

"IS THIS THE OPERATORS?"

"YES IT IS" I SAY, NICE AS PIE

"COULD YOU GET MY PRINTOUTS OUT PLEASE.  I NEED THEM URGENTLY, AND I PRINTED
THEM OVER 5 MINUTES AGO"

"YOUR USERNAME?" I ASK

HE GIVES IT TO ME, AND I WRITE IT DOWN FOR LATER.  "NO WORRIES AT ALL!" I SAY,
AND HEAD TO THE PRINTERS.

THERE'S A HUUUUUUUGE PILE OF PRINTOUTS THERE, AND SURE ENOUGH, HIS IS AT THE
TOP OF THE PILE.  I PICK IT UP, SPLIT IT OUT OF THE REST AND POUR OUR INK-
STAINED CLEANING ALCOHOL ALL OVER IT, RUN IT OVER A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH THE
LOADED TAPE TROLLEY THEN SLAM IT IN THE TAPE SAFE DOOR SOME TIMES AS WELL.

BEAUTIFUL.

"HERE'S YOUR PRINTOUT" I SAY "SORRY ABOUT THE DELAY, WE'VE GOT A FEW PRINTER
PROBLEMS."

HE TAKES A LOOK AND SHITS HIMSELF.

"WELL, CAN I PRINT IT AGAIN?" HE ASKS, WORRIED

"SURE YOU CAN" I SAY "BUT NO PROMISES, THE PRINTER'S A BIT STUFFED TODAY"

"WELL CAN I PRINT IT ON LASER - IS THAT WORKING?"

"YEAH OF COURSE, BUT THAT'LL COST YOU" I SAY, OOZING COMPASSION FOR THE GEEK

"IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE COST, THIS IS URGENT!"

I SLIDE-ON BACK INTO THE PRINTER ROOM AND PUT IN THE TONER CARTRIDGE WE SAVE
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS - THE ONE THAT PRINTS THICK BLACK LINES DOWN THE MIDDLE
OF THE PAGE AND IS ALL FAINT ON ONE SIDE.  IT TOOK ME QUITE A WHILE TO MAKE IT
LIKE THAT TOO.  THE PRINTOUT SHOOTS THROUGH AND I BRING IT OUT IMMEDIATELY -
I DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS!

"W-W-WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY PRINTOUT?" HE GEEK-SQUEALS AT ME.
LUCKY I WROTE THAT USERNAME DOWN - I'M REALLY STARTING TO DEVELOP A TASTE FOR
TORTURE.

"WELL NOTHING.  I MEAN SURE, IT'S A LITTLE SOILED, BUT THAT CARTRIDGE HAS
ALREADY DONE 47 THOUSAND PAGES AND BEEN REFILLED 17 TIMES.  IT'S QUITE GOOD
COMPARED TO SOME WE GET"

GEEK PAYS UP AND STARTS BLUBBING.

"HEY NOW.  THERE'S NO REASON TO CRY!  HAVE YOU GOT A DISK WITH YOUR WORK ON
IT?"

HE GIVES ME A BOX OF DISKETTES AND I STEP INSIDE AND RUN THEM ACROSS THE BULK
ERASER.  I COME BACK OUT AGAIN.

"SORRY, I JUST REMEMBERED, OUR MACHINE IS ON THE FRITZ, YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE 
THESE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF CAMPUS TO THE MACHINE THERE, IT'LL PRINT THEM OK,
AND IT HAD A BRAND-NEW TONER YESTERDAY."

"GREAT!"

"NO WORRIES.  OH, AND HOLD THE DISKS ABOVE YOUR HEAD THE WHOLE WAY THERE, THE
EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS PARTICULARLY STRONG TODAY."

"HUH?"

"NO ARGUEMENTS, JUST DO IT."

HE WANDERS OFF, HAND HELD HIGH.  SHIT I HATE MYSELF SOMETIMES.

                        BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #5

I'M BORED SENSELESS, SO I PASS THE TIME BY READING USERS EMAIL.  I MUST ADMIT
THAT TODAY'S LOT IS PARTICULARLY BORING, NOT ONE GOOD MESSAGE IN ALL OF THEM.
I WAS EXPECTING AT LEAST SOME VEILED REFERENCE TO A GROPE IN A STOREROOM, BUT
NOTHING.  SO I'M BORED SENSELESS BY THE USUAL DRIVEL ABOUT SOME RELATIVE'S
SURGERY AND HOW THE WEATHER IS OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD - THAT SORT
OF CRAP.

TO RELIEVE THE BOREDOM, I REMOVE A E-MAIL PARTY INVITE FROM A USER'S MAIL
AND POST IT UNDER THE SENDERS USERNAME TO TO ALT.SINGLES.WITH.SEVERE.SOCIAL.
DYSFUNCTIONS ON NEWS, AND MAKE A NOTE IN MY DIARY TO BE THERE WITH MY
CAMCORDER.  SHOULD BE A BLAST!

  NEXT IN LINE IS THE ONLINE MEDICAL RECORDS DATABASE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY
DOCTORS STORE THE CURRENT MEDICAL HISTORIES OF THE STAFF.  I GREP IT QUICKLY
FOR "HERPES" AND "SYPHILLUS" AND SELL THE RESULTS TO THE LOCAL SCUM NEWSPAPER.
I COVER MY TRACKS BY ADDING AN ENTRY TO ONE OF THE DOCTOR'S ONLINE ELECTRONIC
DIARYS FOR YESTERDAY SAYING "$500, MED RECS TO PAPER"  I THINK THAT'S ALL IT
SHOULD TAKE..

I MOVE SOME TAPES FROM THE RACKS TO THE TROLLEY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE REALLY
USE THEM, THEN START LOOKING THRU ARCHIE LISTINGS FOR A HIDDEN X-GIF SITE.  I
FIND ONE THEN START A BATCH JOB RUNNING UNDER SOME USER'S ACCOUNT TO GET THEM
ALL BACK, CHARGED TO HIM.  I MAKE SURE HE'S GOT ENOUGH DISK FOR THE JOB BY
REMOVING ANY FILES NOT RELATED TO THE TASK AT HAND.  LIKE ALL THOSE "DOCTORATE
FINAL REPORT" PAPERS THAT HAVE GOT QUITE LARGE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

I GO BACK TO THE MAIL NOW, AS SOMETHING'S BOUND TO HAVE HAPPENED.  I DO A GREP
ON ALL MAIL FILES FOR THE WORDS "PREGNANT" AND "FAMILY WAY", AND POST THEM
ANONYMOUSLY TO THE LOCAL GENERAL INTEREST NEWSGROUP.

THEN, BEFORE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, THE POWER GOES OUT!  THE NEXT SECOND, THE
PHONE RINGS.

"HELLO?" I SAY, ANNOYED - THE COYOTE WAS JUST ABOUT TO KILL ROADRUNNER AGAIN!

"HAS THE COMPUT.."

I HANG UP.  THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.  QUICK AS I CAN I RIP THE
COMPUTER POWER CABLE OUT OF THE UPS AND PLUG THE TV IN.  DAMN!  WYLIE MISSED
AGAIN!  

MEANTIME, ALL THE ALARMS ARE GOING OFF LIKE CRAZY AS THE DISKS SPIN DOWN, BUT
THAT'S OK, BECAUSE MY MAC AND TERMINAL ARE HARDWIRED TO THE UPS IN ANY CASE;
AND I'M AT THE BEER FACTORY LEVEL IN DARK CASTLE TOO.

THE PHONE RINGS, SO I PULL THE PABX BREAKER ON THE UPS SWITCHBOARD AND IT
STOPS.  NOW TO LOOK LIKE I'M WORKING.  I BREAK OUT THE PUCK AND THE HOCKEY
STICK AND PLAY A LITTLE ONE-ON-WALL.  FROM THE OBSERVATION WINDOW IT'LL LOOK
LIKE I'M BEING BLINDINGLY EFFICIENT, AS PER USUAL.

10 MINUTES LATER, THE POWER IS BACK AND WE'RE TWO HDA'S DOWN, BUT WHAT THE
HELL, I HAVEN'T LOST A MAN, I'M ONTO THE FINAL SCREEN, AND THERE'S MORE
CARTOONS!

THE PHONE RINGS, IT'S A LUSER.  (WHAT A SURPRISE)

"COMPUTER ROOM" I SAY, BEING EFFICIENT

"HELLO, WHEN WILL THE COMPU..."

I HANG UP.
I'M DOING WELL IN THE SCREEN, ALL I NEED DO IS GET PAST THE WIZARD WHO THROWS
SPELLS AT YOU AND I'M IN!

THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN.  I PUT IT ON HANDS FREE

"COMPUTER ROOM" I SHOUT, STILL DEEP IN THE GAME.

"I'VE LOST MY FILES" A USER WHINES OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER

"YOU BET YOU HAVE" I SAY, AS MY CONCENTRATION LAPSES JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR
ME TO GET ZAPPED BY THE WIZARD.

"WHAT WAS YOUR USERNAME?" I SAY, ALL SWEETNESS AND SMILES

HE TELLS ME, I LOOK, AND HE'S RIGHT.  SHIT, AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT!

NOT TO BE OUTDONE, I CHANGE HIS LOGIN DIRECTORY TO THE NULL DEVICE, SET HIS
PATH TO "." AND REDEFINE THE COMMAND "NEWS" TO EXECUTE A SCRIPT IN HIS OLD
LOGIN DIRECTORY TO SEND A NASTY MESSAGE TO THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES OFFICER,
THEN DELETE ITSELF.

NOW THAT'S TRYING!

IT'S FRIDAY, SO I GET INTO WORK EARLY, BEFORE LUNCH EVEN.  THE PHONE RINGS.
SHIT!

I TURN THE PAGE ON THE EXCUSE SHEET.  "SOLAR FLARES" STARES OUT AT ME.  I'D 
BETTER READ UP ON THAT.  TWO MINUTES LATER I'M READY TO ANSWER THE PHONE.

"HELLO?"  I SAY.

"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU ALL MORNING?!"

I HATE IT WHEN THEY SHOUT AT ME EARLY IN THE MORNING.  IT ALWAYS PUTS ME IN A
BAD MOOD.   YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

"AH, YES.   WELL, THERE'S BEEN SOME SOLAR ACTIVITY THIS MORNING, IT ALWAYS
DISRUPTS ELECTRONICS..."  I SAY, SWEET AS A SUGAR PIE.

"HUH?  BUT I COULD GET THROUGH TO MY FRIENDS?!"

"YES, THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, SOLAR ACTIVITY IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE IN IT'S
EFFECTS.  WHY LAST WEEK, WE HAD SOME FILES JUST DISSAPPEAR FROM A GUYS ACCOUNT
WHILE HE WAS WORKING ON IT!"

"REALLY?"

"STRAIGHT UP!   HEY, DO YOU WANT ME TO CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT?"

"YES PLEASE, I'VE GOT SOME IMPORTANT STUFF IN THERE!"

"OK, WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME..."

HE TELLS ME.  HONESTLY, IT'S LIKE SHOOTING A FISH IN A BARREL.  TWICE.
WITH AN ELEPHANT GUN.  AT POINT BLANK RANGE.  IN THE HEAD.

(DO I REALLY NEED TO TELL YOU THE CLICKY CLICKY BIT?  I THINK NOT)

"HOW MANY FILES ARE IN YOUR ACCOUNT?"  I ASK

"UM, WELL THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT 20 IN MY THESIS WRITEUP, 10 OR SO WITH THE
DATA FOR IT, AND ANOTHER 20 OR SO IN A BOOK THAT I'M WRITING"

"HMMM.  WELL, I THINK WE CAUGHT IT JUST IN TIME.  YOU'VE STILL GOT 2 FILES
LEFT...  .CSHRC AND .LOGIN"

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHH!"

HE SOBS INTO THE RECEIVER A BIT - IT REALLY TURNS MY STOMACH.

"WHAT CAN I DO?" HE SNIFFS

"OK, DO YOU HAVE ANY OF YOUR STUFF BACKED UP ON FLOPPY?"

"SOME, BUT IT'S WEEKS OLD!"

I FIRE UP THE BULK ERASER.

"OK" I SAY "HOW ABOUT I COME OUT AND LOAD ALL THAT DATA ONTO YOUR ACCOUNT
PRONTO SO YOU CAN GET SOME WORK DONE?"

"THAT'D BE GREAT, BUT IT'S ALL AT HOME" HE WIMPERS.  "I SPOSE I'LL JUST LOAD
IT ALL IN MYSELF TONIGHT"

"SURE.  BUT REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, SOLAR FLARES ARE BAD FOR DISKS AND MACHINES.
PROTECT YOUR DISKS FROM SOLAR ACTIVITY TO PREVENT THEM LOSING THEIR DATA"

"HOW DO I DO THAT?  WRAP THEM IN TIN-FOIL?"

"NO!  TIN FOIL'S THE WORST THING!  YOU KNOW WHAT TIN FOIL DOES IN A MICROWAVE
DON'T YOU?!"

"YES.."

"THEN DON'T USE IT.  THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT PROTECTS DISKS FROM SOLAR
ACTIVITY.."

"WHAT'S THAT?"

"MAGNETS.  WRAP YOUR DISKS UP IN A PILLOW CASE WITH LOTS OF MAGNETS - SOLAR
FLARES HATE THAT"

"WOW!  THANKS"

"NO WORRIES AT ALL..."

SHIT I'M GOOD!

                        BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #7

SO I MANAGE AT LONG LAST, TO GET A COUPLE OF HOURS OFF FOR LUNCH, AND, BECAUSE
I CAN'T LEAVE MY DESK UNATTENDED, I GET THE JANITOR IN AND HAVE HIM SIT IN
MY CHAIR.  I TELL HIM THAT ALL HE HAS TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE RECEIVER DOESN'T
ACCIDENTALLY GET PUT BACK ON THE HOOK. HE AGREES AND I'M OFF.

FIRST STOP, THE BANK.   I CHANGE A $50 NOTE INTO QUARTERS AND THEN ASK TO SEE
A BALANCE OF MY ACCOUNT.  THEN I YANK THE POWER LEAD OUT OF THE TELLER'S VDU.
IT DIES.  I SAY I'M IN A HURRY AND IS THE MANAGER AROUND?

HE ROLLS OVER LIKE A MAN-SIZED TWINKIE AND ASKS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  I SAY
THAT ALL I WANT IS A BALANCE OF MY ACCOUNTS.  I CROSS MY FINGERS.  YES!
HE FINDS THE VDU LEAD OUT, PLUGS IT IN, AND LOGS IN, TO THE MANAGER'S ACCOUNT.
NOW'S MY CHANCE - I SLIP UP AGAINST THE COUNTER, SLOPPING 200 COINS ACROSS THE
COUNTER.  THE MANAGER IGNORES IT, BUT ALL THE TELLERS DIVE FOR THE MONEY.  I
WATCH, UNOBSERVED, AS THE MANAGER TYPES IN HIS PASSWORD AT THE BREAKNECK SPEED
OF ONE CHARACTER A MINUTE.  AT THAT RATE I SHOULD'VE GOT $100 WORTH....
HE FINISHES TYPING.   "MONEY".  WHAT A TOUGHY!  WELL, THAT'S MY MORTGAGE TAKEN
CARE OF TONIGHT...

A USER THAT I RECOGNISE FROM "D(ELETION) DAY '89" APPROACHES.  I THINK HE'S
GOING TO TALK TO ME.  EVEN THE BANK MANAGER IS SHAKING HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY.
BUT IT'S TOO LATE, HE STOPS.

"UM, EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IS THE BEST COMPUTER TO BUY TO DO MY
THESIS ON?

?!

RIGHT.

"YOU'VE HEARD OF COMMODORE 64'S?" I ASK

"YES?.."

"AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!  NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS, BUT COMPUTERS AREN'T
MADE TO HANDLE THAT MUCH MEMORY - IT'S OVER 64,000 THINGS, MORE IN SOME CASES.
IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER!"

"OH!"

"TRY SOMETHING SAFE AND PROVEN.  A ZX81 WITH DUAL CASSETTE DRIVE IF YOU CAN
GET IT.  THE 1K RAM MODEL.  WRITE THAT DOWN.  DON'T BUY A DISK DRIVE - YOU
KNOW HOW THEY'RE ALWAYS FAILING, BUT MUSIC CASSETTES LAST FOREVER!"

"HEY THANKS!"

"NO WORRIES.  WHAT WAS YOUR USERNAME AGAIN?"

HE TELLS ME.  JUST IN TIME FOR D-DAY 92.  YOU'D THINK THEY'D LEARN.

I GET BACK TO WORK AND THE JANITOR'S ASLEEP AT THE TERMINAL.  I ASK HIM IF HE
WANTS TO WORK HERE TOO, BUT HE LIKES THE ABILITY TO BUST IN ON PEOPLE WHEN
THEY'RE IN THE TOILET...  

I PUT THE PHONE BACK ON THE HOOK, AND STRAIGHT AWAY IT RINGS.  I HATE IT WHEN
IT DOES THAT, IT TAKES ME AGES TO GET MY WALKMAN PHONES IN.

IT'S THE HOTTEST HOSEMONSTER I'VE EVER MET, AND SHE'S GOT A COMPUTER PROBLEM!
I LOVE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!

"WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME?" I ASK

SHE TELLS ME (AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW)

QUICK AS I CAN I READ ALL HER E-MAIL (MOSTLY BORING STUFF), THEN GREP EVERYONE
ELSE'S MAIL FILES FOR HER USERNAME.  NOTHING.  EXCELLENT!

"WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?" I ASK, ALL SMILES AND CHARM.

"I CAN'T SAVE MY DOCUMENTS, IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT SPACE."

"NOT A PROBLEM FOR LONG" I SAY, AND DELETE EVERYONE ELSE ON THE SAME DISK AS
HER.  "YOU SHOULD BE FINE NOW.."

"THANK YOU SO MUCH" SHE GUSHES.  
I MAKE A MENTAL NOTE TO DO SOMETHING TO HER ACCOUNT AGAIN TOMORROW.
"NO WORRIES."

THE PHONE RINGS ALMOST BEFORE I'VE GOT IT ON THE HOOK.

"MY FILES ARE ALL GONE!" A VOICE WHINES OUT AT ME.

"WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?" I ASK.

"JUST NOW..." HE SAYS, THROUGH THE TEARS

"I SEE.  WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY, THERE'S THREE DAYS TILL THE END OF THE
SEMESTER, IF YOU WORK DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL THEN, YOU SHOULD GET AT LEAST A C-"

HE SOBS A COUPLE MORE TIMES THEN HANGS UP.  WHAT A WIMP.

THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN!

"THE SCREEN ON MY PC IS REALLY DIM" THE WOMAN AT THE OTHER END SAYS  "SHOULD I
WIND THE BRIGHTNESS KNOB UP?"

"NO!" I SCREAM  "DON'T TOUCH THAT KNOB!  HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF THE RADIATION
THAT COMES OUT OF THAT THING WHEN THE KNOB GETS WOUND UP?!!!!"

"WELL I..." SHE SAYS, ALL UNCERTAIN

"TAKE MY ADVICE!"  I SAY "THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIX A DIM DISPLAY, AND THAT'S
BY POWER SURGING THE DRIVERS"

THE WORDS "POWER SURGING" AND "DRIVERS" HAVE GOT HER.  PEOPLE HEAR WORDS LIKE
THAT AND GO INTO DUMMY MODE AND DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.  I COULD TELL HER TO RUN
NAKED ACROSS CAMPUS WITH A POWERCORD RAMMED UP HER BACKSIDE AND SHE'D PROBABLY
DO IT...  HMMM...

"HAVE YOU GOT A SPARE POWER CORD?"

"NO.."

"OH WELL, NEVER MIND, WE'LL HAVE TO DO THE POWER SURGE IDEA...  OK, QUICK AS
YOU CAN, I WANT YOU TO FLICK THE POWER SWITCH OF YOUR PC ON AND OFF 30 TIMES"

"SHOULD I TAKE MY DISKS OUT?"

"NO!  DO YOU WANT TO LOSE ALL YOUR DATA!?!"

"OH.  NO!  OK.."

I LISTEN CAREFULLY.. ..

...CLICKY..CLIKCY...CLIKKY.. .. .. ...CLICKY.     ...CLICCY..
 . . BOOM!

AMAZING, IT PROBABLY MADE IT TO 27 - THE POWER SUPPLY USUALLY SHITS ITSELF
AT 15 OR SO...

"MY COMPUTER BLEW UP!!!" SHE SCREAMS AT ME DOWN THE LINE

"REALLY?  MUST'VE BEEN A DODGY POWER SUPPLY!  LUCKY WE FOUND OUT NOW!  IS YOUR
MACHINE STILL UNDER WARRANTY?"

"NO!"

"DEAR OH DEAR.  WELL, BEST GET IT REPAIRED THEN.  DID YOU BACKUP YOUR FILES?"

"YES, TO THE SYSTEM, YESTERDAY, BUT ALL THIS MORNING'S WORK IS GONE!"

"OH DEAR.  WHAT WAS YOUR USERNAME, I'LL JUST CHECK THAT YOUR BACKUPS WORKED
OK?"

SHE TELLS ME....
